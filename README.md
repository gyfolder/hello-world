The practice repository of how to upload github.

Hello! This is Giyong Park! I'm just started Github, and I'm a self-learning programmer in Korea.
I started Programming in 2011, when My age is just 8. now, I'm 18 years old, I usually say "I would upload files many if I would think doing Github, but I'm just keeping downloading and viewing comments." Now, I'll stop this saying and act a lot as possible.

In addition, I'm learning English in 2021. please understand my poor English and please comment If I uses wrong expression.
